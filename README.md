# simple-MERN-app

What is this Repository contain?  => A simple MERN project that will add products to your list.

Project Description  => This is a simple MERN project. This project contains a backend and a frontend folder. Backend contains serverside logic and frontend contains UI part. Ihavent used any database in this project as I wanted to keep this simple. So, instead I have used a temporary array to store the data. At startup, a basic page will open up which will take product name and its price from the user. As user will add this product into the list, he/she will be able to see that at the bottom of the input portion as a list.
